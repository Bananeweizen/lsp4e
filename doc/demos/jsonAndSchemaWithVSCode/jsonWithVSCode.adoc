= Demoing JSon edition using VSCode language server

== Shows

. Validation/dignostics
. Completion
. Hover
. Outline
. Association with Launch Configuration

== Known issues/limitations of demo

. Misses support for parameter capturing ( `{}` )
. Hover are shown as plain text instead of markdown (as spec'd by the protocol), that's https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508486

== Requirements

. Eclipse IDE and LSP4E
. VSCode (ideally installed in its "standard" location according to OS)

== Preparation (off demo)

. Get VSCode installed and working. Test it for a JSon file, verify completion works.
. Start Eclipse IDE with at least the following bundles available (check in target IDE whether plugins are loaded)
.. org.eclipse.lsp4e
.. org.eclipse.lsp4e.languages
. Check the Launch Configuration `VSCode-JSON`: the path to `jsonServerMain.js` is correct
. If NOT correct: fix it replacing the few 1st segments to the path where VSCode is located
. Create a project in the workspace, copy the file `something.json` in it
. Open `something.json` with Generic Editor (make sure it is actually the Generic Editor and not WTP's JSon Editor)
. Try Hovering on a field and make sure you see description
. Open Outline
. Close editors

== Demo

=== Edition

. Open `something.json` with Generic Editor
. Show Outline, expand the `properties` node to show consistency with text
. Hover
.. on `schema` line, mention that schema provides most of the logic here. Show the Hover description of the schema.
.. on `minItems`, show hover
. Diagnostics
.. add a comma `,` and a new line after the minItems line
.. Show error marker on the ruler and error marker on text.
.. Hover on error marker and then on marked text => Error cause
. Completion
.. on the new line, do Ctrl+Space
.. show all possible values, select a few of them to show additional information in popup
.. Start typing `max`, completion proposals are filtered, and matching substring is highlights
.. Select `maxItems`, hit Enter => field is added (with necessary `""`)
. Diagnostics
.. after `"maxItems": `, type `"zero"` (with quotes)
.. show warning message by hovering on text
. Outline
.. show that `maxItems` was added to outline
.. show that `maxItems` has an error marker also in outline

=== Preferences

. Window > Preferences > Language Servers
.. Show association of JSON content-type with VSCode-JSON launch config
.. Mention ability to add language servers without installing a plugin
.. But also mention ability to fully define a LS and a mapping from a plugin.xml

Another demo (still te be described) will explain how to add support for a language server from scratch

== Possible directions for future contributors

. Markdown in hover https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508486
. Parameter capturing (`{}` in completion)
. Filter in Outline https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508473
